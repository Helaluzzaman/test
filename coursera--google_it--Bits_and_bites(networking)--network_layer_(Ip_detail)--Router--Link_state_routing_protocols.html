Linked state protocols got their name because each router advertises the state of the link of each of its interfaces. These interfaces can be connected to other routers or they could be direct connections to networks. The information about each router is propagated to every other router on the autonomous system. This means that every router on the system knows every detail about every other router in the system. Each router then uses this much larger set of information and runs complicated algorithms against it to determine what the best path to any destination network might be. <br />Routing Protocol link : The most common link state protocol is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First">OSPF, or Open Shortest Path First</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2328">IETF RFC2328</a>).</div></body></html>
