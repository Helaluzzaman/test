<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Host file</h1><br/>Like DNS but only stay in computer for special perpose.<br />Host file: A host file is a flat file that contains on each line a network address followed by the host name it can be referred to as.<br /><br />Hosts files are evaluated by the networking stack of the operating system itself. That means, the presence of an entry there would translate to anywhere you might refer to a networking address. <br /><br />Loop back address: a loopback address is a way of sending network traffic to yourself. Sending traffic to a loopback address bypasses all network infrastructure itself, and traffic like that never leaves the node. The loopback IP for IPV4 is 127.0.0.1. And it's still, to this day.<br />Almost every hosts file in existence will in the very least contain a line that reads "127.0.0.1 localhost," most likely followed by "::1 localhost, <br /><br />hosts files are a popular way for computer viruses to disrupt and redirect user's traffic. </div></body></html>
