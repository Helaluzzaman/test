<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Ipv6 and Ip4 Harmony</h1><br/>Ipv4 to Ipv6:<br /><img src="images\377-1.png" alt="images\377-1.png" /><br />Ipv6 starts with 80 zeros then with 16 ones .<br /><br />Ipv6 to Ipv4 : (for going through core internet , tunnel is now in use)<br />Tunnel:These IPv6 tunnel servers take incoming IPv6 traffic and encapsulate it within traditional IPv4 datagrams.<br /><br />IPv6 tunnel broker: These are companies that provide IPv6 tunneling endpoints for you, so you don't have to introduce additional equipment to your network.<br /><br />Suppliment:While IPv6 adoption becomes more widespread, it'll need a way to  travel over the old IPv4 remnants of the Internet backbone. The primary  way this is achieved today is through IPv6 tunnels.  IPv6 tunnels are conceptually pretty simple. They consist of IPv6 tunnel  servers on either end of a connection. These IPv6 tunnel servers take  incoming IPv6 traffic and encapsulate it within traditional IPv4  datagrams. This is then delivered across the IPv4 Internet space where  it's received by another IPv6 tunnel server. That server performs the  de-encapsulation and passes the IPv6 traffic further along in the  network.<br />There are a lot of competing protocols to be used for  these kinds of IPv6 tunnels. Since this is still a new and evolving  space, it's not clear who the winner will be. Some of the main  competitors are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6in4">6in4</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_Setup_Protocol">Tunnel Setup Protocol</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anything_In_Anything">Anything in Anything (AYIYA)</a>.<br /></div></body></html>
