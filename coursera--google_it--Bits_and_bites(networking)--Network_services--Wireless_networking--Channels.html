<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Channels</h1><br/>Channels: Channels are individual, smaller sections of the overall frequency band used by a wireless network.<br />Collision Domain: A collision domain is any one network segment where one computer can interrupt another.<br /><br />In cable connection collision domain is reduced by switch, but in wireless device there is no physical connection so no switches. <br />Channels help to fix this problem working like wireless switch. <br /><br />Wireless wifi that works on 2.4 Ghz that roughly the band from 2.4 Ghz to 2.5 Ghz.There are a number of channels in these two frequence band each with a width of certain megahartz. such as 22 megahartz.<br /><br />IN 2.4 Ghz and width 22 megahartz:<br />channel 1 : 2401 megahartz to 2423 megahartz. <br /><img src="images\362-1.png" alt="images\362-1.png" /><br />Many channels overlaps but some channels are far away from each other that they are totally isolated so they cannot be overlaped.<br />here 1, 6 , 11 channels will never overlap at all.<br /><br />How to get rid of channels conjestion:<br /> Today, most wireless networking equipment is built to auto sense what channels are most congested. Some access points will only perform this analysis when they start up, others will dynamically change their channel as needed. Between those two scenarios and manually specified channels, you can still run into situations where you experience heavy channel congestion. This is especially true in dense urban areas with lots of wireless networks in close proximity. So, why is this important in the world of I.T. support? Well, understanding how these channels overlap for all of the 802.11 specifications is a way you can help troubleshoot bad wireless connectivity problems or slowdowns in the network. You want to avoid collision domains wherever you can. I should call out that it's not important to memorize all of the individual numbers we've talked about. The point is to understand how collision domains are a necessary problem with all wireless networks, and how you can use your knowledge in this space to optimize wireless network deployments. You want to make sure that both your own access points and those of neighboring businesses overlap channels as little as possible. <br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
