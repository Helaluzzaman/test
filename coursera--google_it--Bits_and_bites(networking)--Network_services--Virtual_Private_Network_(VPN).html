<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h1><br/>VPN is not a strickly define protocol rather a general techonology concept.<br />It works through an encripted tunnel. It is tunneling protocol.<br /><br />VPN: Virtual Private Networks or VPNs, are a technology that allows for the extension of a private or local network, to a host that might not work on that same local network. <br />Or, VPNs are a technology that use encrypted tunnels to allow for a remote computer or network, to act as if it's connected to a network that it's not actually physically connected to.<br /><br />working process: Most VPNs work by using the payload section of the transport layer to carry an encrypted payload that actually contains an entire second set of packets. The network, the transport, and the application layers of a packet intended to traverse the remote network. Basically, this payload is carried to the VPNs endpoint, where all the other layers are stripped away and discarded. Then, the payload is unencrypted, leaving the VPN server with the top three layers of a new packet. This gets encapsulated with the proper data link layer information, and sent out across the network. This process is completed in the inverse, in the opposite direction. <br /><br />Securiy: VPNs, usually requires strict authentication procedures in order to ensure that they can only be connected to by computers and users authorized to do so. </div></body></html>
