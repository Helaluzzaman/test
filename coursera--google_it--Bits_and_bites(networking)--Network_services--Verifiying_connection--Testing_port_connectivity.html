As a result,  The default action the command does just use echo request.<br /><br />When  using the netcat command to test a network port, which option will  provide output that is not useful for scripting, but is useful for the  human eye? <br />answer: -v ; verbose.<br />(The “-v” flag, which stands for verbose, is useful as it formats the command’s output to be readable to human eyes.)<br /><br /><br /><br /><h2>Supplemental Reading for Testing Port Connectivity</h2><br /><br />Sometimes,  you need to know if network connectivity is working at the transport  layer. For this, there are two super powerful tools at your disposal: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat">Netcat (nc)</a> on Linux and macOS, and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/nettcpip/test-netconnection">Test-NetConnection</a> on Windows. <br />The Netcat tool can be run through the command nc, and has two  mandatory arguments, a host and a port. Running this command would try  to establish a connection on port 80 to google.com:<br />If  the connection fails, the command will exit. If it succeeds, you'll see  a blinking cursor, waiting for more input. This is a way for you to  actually send application layer data to the listening service from your  own keyboard. If you're really only curious about the status of a  report, you can issue the command, with a -z flag, which stands for zero  input/output mode. A -v flag, which stands for verbose, is also useful  in this scenario. So now, the command looks like this:<br /><img src="images\366-1.png" alt="images\366-1.png" /><br />By  issuing the netcat command with the -Z and -V flags, the command's  output will simply tell you if a connection to the port in question is  possible or not, like this:<br /><img src="images\366-2.png" alt="images\366-2.png" /><br />On  Windows, Test-NetConnection is a command with some similar  functionality. If you run Test-NetConnection with only a host specified,  it will default to using an ICMP echo request, much like the program  ping. But, it will display way more data, including the data link layer  protocol being used. When you issue Test-NetConnection with the -Port  flag, you can ask it to test connectivity to a specific port. For  example, this command tests a TCP connection to google.com:<br /><img src="images\366-3.png" alt="images\366-3.png" /><br />Test-NetConnection will return output that looks something like this: <br /><br />It's  important to call out that both netcat and Test-NetConnection are way  more powerful than the brief port connectivity examples we've covered  here. In fact, they're such complex tools that covering all of their  functionality would be too much for one video. You should read up about  all of the other things these super powerful tools can do in the  Wikipedia article for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat">Netcat (nc)</a>, and in the documentation for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/nettcpip/test-netconnection">Test-NetConnection</a>.<br /><br /></div></body></html>
