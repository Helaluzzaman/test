By doing this clever little action, traceroute makes sure that the very first packet sent will be discarded by the first router hop. This results in an ICMP Time Exceeded message, the second packet will make it to the second router, the third will make it to the third, and so on. This continues until the packet finally makes it all the way to its destination. For each hop, traceroute will send three identical packets. <br /></div></body></html>
