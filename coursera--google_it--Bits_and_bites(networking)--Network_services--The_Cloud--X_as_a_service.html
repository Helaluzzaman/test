<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">X as a service</h1><br/>X as a service:<br />Cloud can be described as infrastructure as a Service.<br /><br />IaaS&gt; PaaS&gt; SaaS<br /><br />(Infrastructure as a service abstracts away the physical infrastructure you need and platform as a service abstracts away the server instances you need.)<br /><br />IaaS: You should not have to worry about building your own network or your own servers.<br /><br />PaaS: Platform as a service is a subset of cloud computing where a platform is provided for customer to run their service.<br />(This basically means that an execution engine is provided for whatever software someone wants to run.)<br /><br />SaaS: Software as a service is essentially a way of licensing the use of software to others while keeping that software centrally hosted and managed.<br />such as: gmail for bussiness, office 365 outlook.<br /><br />For the application of SaaS, web browsers have become so feature packed.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
