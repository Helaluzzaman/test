<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">DNS registration</h1><br/>DNS is a global system managed in a tiered hierarchy with<span style="color:#65ff00;"> ICANN</span> at the top level.<br />Register:  a registrar, an organization responsible for assigning individual domain names to other organizations or individual. <br />such as : Network solution Inc (first), namecheep etc.<br /><br /><br />Domain name transfer:  Domain names can also be transferred by one party to another and from one registrar to another. The way this usually works is that the recipient registrar will generate a unique string of characters to prove that you own the domain and that you're allowed to transfer it to someone else. You configure your DNS settings to contain the string in a specific record, usually a TXT record. Once this information has propagated, it can be confirmed that you both own the domain and approve its transfer. After that, ownership would move to the new owner or registrar. </div></body></html>
