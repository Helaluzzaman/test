<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">RFC</h1><br/>RFC or Request for Comments. RFCs started as a way for academics to discuss how their computers might talk to each other.<br /><br />An RFC would be published, people would leave comments, eventually a  consensus would be formed, and a new standard would be developed.<br />Over many decades, RFCs have come to belong to the IETF, or <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>,  which is an open community charged with developing and maintaining the  standards required for the Internet to continue to operate.<br />You can browse the impressively large collections of RFCs <a href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/">here</a>.<br />By the way, RFCs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day_Request_for_Comments">have a long history of April Fool’s Day jokes</a>. My personal favorites are <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149">RFC 1149</a> and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3514.txt">RFC 3514</a>, both of which might be funnier once we’ve tackled the next module.</div></body></html>
