<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Non Routable address</h1><br/>There are three address spaces that any one can use and non routable.<br /><br /><span style="color:#65ff00;">• 10.0.0.0/8<br />• 172.16.0.0/12<br />• 192.168.0.0/16<br /></span><br /> These ranges are free for anyone to use for their internal networks. Only  interior gateway protocols will route these address spaces.<br /> NT: RFC 1918 defined three ranges of IP addresses that will never be routed anywhere by co-routers. That means that they belong to no one and that anyone can use them. In fact, since they are separated from the way traffic moves across the internet, there's no limiting to how many people might use these addresses for their internal networks. <br /> </div></body></html>
