These  ports are represented by a single 16-bit number, meaning that they can  represent the numbers 0-65535.<br />This range has been split up by the <a href="https://www.iana.org/">IANA</a> (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) into independent sections:<br />Port  0 isn’t in use for network traffic, but it’s sometimes used in  communications taking place between different programs on the same  computer.<br />Ports 1-1023 are referred to as system ports, or sometimes as “well-known ports.”  These ports represent the official ports for most well-known network  services. In an earlier video, we talked about how HTTP normally  communicates over port 80, while FTP usually communicates over port 21.  In most operating systems, administrator-level access is needed to start  a program that listens on a system port.<br />Ports 1024-49151 are known as registered ports.  These ports are used for lots of other network services that might not  be quite as common as the ones that are on system ports. A good example  of a registered port is 3306, which is the port that many databases  listen on. Registered ports are sometimes officially registered and  acknowledged by the IANA, but not always. On most operating systems, any  user of any access level can start a program listening on a registered  port.<br />Finally, we have ports 49152-65535. These are known as private or ephemeral ports.  Ephemeral ports can’t be registered with the IANA and are generally  used for establishing outbound connections. You should remember that all  TCP traffic uses a destination port and a source port. When a client  wants to communicate with a server, the client will be assigned an  ephemeral port to be used for just that one connection, while the server  listens on a static system or registered port.<br />Not all operating  systems follow the ephemeral port recommendations of the IANA. In this  lesson, we’ll continue to assume that the ephemeral ports used for  outbound connections consist of the ports 49152 through 65535. But it’s  important to know that this exact range can vary depending on the  platform you’re working on. Sometimes portions of the registered ports  range are used, but no modern operating system will ever use a system  port for outbound communication<br />To learn more about ports, and to see a list of what ports have been assigned to what services, check out the IANA <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers">Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry</a>. A similar list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">on Wikipedia</a> is not official, but it is a little easier to read.
