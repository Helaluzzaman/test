Fiber connection<br /><br />CO : Central Office.<br /><img src="images\354-1.png" alt="images\354-1.png" /><br /><img src="images\354-2.png" alt="images\354-2.png" /><br /><br /><span style="color:#65ff00;">T-carrier techonology</span>:<span style="color:#000000;"> T-carrier technologies were originally invented by AT&amp;T in order to transmit multiple phone calls over a single link.</span> It uses twisted pair cables.<br />The first T-Carrier specification called T1 for short. With the T1 specification, AT&amp;T invented a way to carry up to 24 simultaneous phone calls across a single piece of twisted pair copper.Which can carry 1.544 mbps.<br />T3 line is 28 T1s all multiplexed achieving a total throughput speed of 44.736 megabits per second. <br /><br /><span style="color:#65ff00;">DSL</span>: Digital subscriber line.(speed 1.544 mbps same as T1 technology)<br /><small>Explanation:  By operating at a frequency range that didn't interfere with normal phone calls, a technology known as digital subscriber line or DSL was able to send much more data across the wire than traditional dial-up technologies. To top it all off, this allowed for normal voice phone calls and data transfer to occur at the same time on the same line. Like how dial-up uses modems, DSL technologies also use their own modems. But, more accurately, they're known as</small><small> DSLAM</small><small>s or Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers</small>. It is a point to point connection.<br /><br />• ADSL : Asymmnetric DSL( for home use , download speed high, upload speed low)<br />• SDSL : symmetric DSL  ( for business use, download and upload speed same)<br />• High bit-rate DSL(HDSL) : <br /><br /><span style="color:#65ff00;">Cable broadband</span>: uses coaxial cable which generally used by cable television delivery into a person's home. like how DSL was developed, cable companies quickly realized that the coaxial cables generally used by cable television delivery into a person's home were capable of transmitting much more data than what was required for TV viewing. By using frequencies that don't interfere with television broadcast, cable-based Internet access technologies were able to deliver high speed Internet access across these same cables. This is the technology that we refer to when we say cable broadband. <br />It is a shared bandwith techonology<br /> <br />Cable modem:  Cable Internet connections are usually managed by a cable modem. This is a device that sits at the edge of a consumer's network and connects it to the CMTS *( It is the proper name of Cable modem). <br /><span style="color:#65ff00;">CMTS</span>: (Cable modem termination system) : The CMTS is what connects lots of different cable connections to an ISP's core network. <br /> <br /><span style="color:#65ff00;">Fiber connection:</span> <br /><span style="color:#65ff00;">ONT:</span>  Instead of a modem, the demarcation point for fiber technologies is known as Optical Network Terminator, or ONT. An ONT converts data from protocols the fiber network can understand to those that are more traditional twisted pair copper networks can understand. <br />FTTX: fiber to the X<br />      <br /><img src="images\354-3.png" alt="images\354-3.png" /><br />        FTTN: fiber to the neighbourhood or to a single physical cabinet.<br />        FTTB : fiber to the basement/ business/ building<br />        FTTH : fiber to the Home<br />        (FTTB, FTTH)&gt; FTTP : fiber to the premises.<br />Rest of the connection by coaxial cables or twisted pair cables.<br /><br /><br />Supplement: Internet  connections used to require very careful setup, configuration and  monitoring. Today, an Internet connection is mostly a working service  provided by an ISP that doesn’t require much maintenance by those that  use it. So it’s unlikely that you’ll actually have to troubleshoot or  diagnose anything to do with the protocols that help broadband, or even  dial-up connections, work.<br />But, in case you want to learn more about these protocols, the two primary ones are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol">PPP, or Point-to-Point Protocol</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1661">IETF RFC1661</a>), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-point_protocol_over_Ethernet">PPPoE, or Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet</a> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2516">IETF Informational RFC2516</a>). They’re both data link layer protocols.  <br /><br /><span style="color:#65ff00;">PPP</span> ( point to point protocol):<br />• ppp operates at L2 of the osi model<br />• Purpose: transport L3 protocols over serial links <br />• Made up of LCP (link control protocol{responsible for link establishment ) and NCP ( network control protocol {responsible for the proper operation of network layer protocal })<br /><br /> <img src="images\354-4.png" alt="images\354-4.png" /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>
